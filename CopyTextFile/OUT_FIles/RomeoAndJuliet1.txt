35                                Enter Chorus.


36          Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
37            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
38            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
39            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
40            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
41            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
42            Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
43            Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
44            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
45            And the continuance of their parents' rage,
46            Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
47            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
48            The which if you with patient ears attend,
49            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
50                                                                 [Exit.]




51        ACT I. Scene I.
52        Verona. A public place.

53        Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
54        of Capulet.


55          Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.

56          Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.

57          Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

58          Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.

59          Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.

60          Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

61          Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

62          Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
63            Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

64          Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
65            the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

66          Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
67            wall.

68          Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
69            are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
70            from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.

71          Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

72          Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
73            fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
74            their heads.

75          Greg. The heads of the maids?

76          Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
77            Take it in what sense thou wilt.

78          Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.

79          Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
80            am a pretty piece of flesh.

81          Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
82            been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
83            Montagues.

84                   Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].


85          Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.

86          Greg. How? turn thy back and run?

87          Samp. Fear me not.

88          Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!

89          Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

90          Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.

91          Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
92            disgrace to them, if they bear it.

93          Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

94          Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.

95          Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

96          Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?

97          Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.

98          Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
99            thumb, sir.

100         Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?

101         Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

102         Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
103           you.

104         Abr. No better.

105         Samp. Well, sir.

106                               Enter Benvolio.


107         Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
108           master's kinsmen.

109         Samp. Yes, better, sir.

110         Abr. You lie.

111         Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
112                                                            They fight.

113         Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
114           Put up your swords. You know not what you do.

115                                 Enter Tybalt.


116         Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
117           Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.

118         Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
119           Or manage it to part these men with me.

120         Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
121           As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
122           Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.

123            Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
124                                 partisans.


125         Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!

126         Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

127                  Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.


128         Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

129         Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?

130         Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
131           And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

132                        Enter Old Montague and his Wife.


133         Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.

134         M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

135                       Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.


136         Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
137           Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
138           Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
139           That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
140           With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
141           On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
142           Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
143           And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
144           Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
145           By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
146           Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
147           And made Verona's ancient citizens
148           Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
149           To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
150           Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
151           If ever you disturb our streets again,
152           Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
153           For this time all the rest depart away.
154           You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
155           And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
156           To know our farther pleasure in this case,
157           To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
158           Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
159                     Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].

160         Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
161           Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

162         Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
163           And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
164           I drew to part them. In the instant came
165           The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
166           Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
167           He swung about his head and cut the winds,
168           Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
169           While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
170           Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
171           Till the Prince came, who parted either part.

172         M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
173           Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

174         Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
175           Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
176           A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
177           Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
178           That westward rooteth from the city's side,
179           So early walking did I see your son.
180           Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
181           And stole into the covert of the wood.
182           I- measuring his affections by my own,
183           Which then most sought where most might not be found,
184           Being one too many by my weary self-
185           Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
186           And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

187         Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
188           With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
189           Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
190           But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
191           Should in the furthest East bean to draw
192           The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
193           Away from light steals home my heavy son
194           And private in his chamber pens himself,
195           Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
196           And makes himself an artificial night.
197           Black and portentous must this humour prove
198           Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

199         Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

200         Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him

201         Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?

202         Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
203           But he, his own affections' counsellor,
204           Is to himself- I will not say how true-
205           But to himself so secret and so close,
206           So far from sounding and discovery,
207           As is the bud bit with an envious worm
208           Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
209           Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
210           Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
211           We would as willingly give cure as know.

212                              Enter Romeo.


213         Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
214           I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

215         Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
216           To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
217                                            Exeunt [Montague and Wife].

218         Ben. Good morrow, cousin.

219         Rom. Is the day so young?

220         Ben. But new struck nine.

221         Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
222           Was that my father that went hence so fast?

223         Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

224         Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.

225         Ben. In love?

226         Rom. Out-

227         Ben. Of love?

228         Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.

229         Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
230           Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

231         Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
232           Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
233           Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
234           Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
235           Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
236           Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
237           O anything, of nothing first create!
238           O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
239           Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
240           Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
241           Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
242           This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
243           Dost thou not laugh?

244         Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.

245         Rom. Good heart, at what?

246         Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.

247         Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
248           Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
249           Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
250           With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
251           Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
252           Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
253           Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
254           Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
255           What is it else? A madness most discreet,
256           A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
257           Farewell, my coz.

258         Ben. Soft! I will go along.
259           An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

260         Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
261           This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

262         Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?

263         Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?

264         Ben. Groan? Why, no;
265           But sadly tell me who.

266         Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
267           Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
268           In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

269         Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.

270         Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.

271         Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

272         Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
273           With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
274           And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
275           From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
276           She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
277           Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
278           Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
279           O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
280           That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

281         Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

282         Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
283           For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
284           Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
285           She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
286           To merit bliss by making me despair.
287           She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
288           Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

289         Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.

290         Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!

291         Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
292           Examine other beauties.

293         Rom. 'Tis the way
294           To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
295           These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
296           Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
297           He that is strucken blind cannot forget
298           The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
299           Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
300           What doth her beauty serve but as a note
301           Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
302           Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

303         Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.




304       Scene II.
305       A Street.

306       Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.


307         Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
308           In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
309           For men so old as we to keep the peace.

310         Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
311           And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
312           But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

313         Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
314           My child is yet a stranger in the world,
315           She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
316           Let two more summers wither in their pride
317           Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

318         Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.

319         Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
320           The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
321           She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
322           But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
323           My will to her consent is but a part.
324           An she agree, within her scope of choice
325           Lies my consent and fair according voice.
326           This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
327           Whereto I have invited many a guest,
328           Such as I love; and you among the store,
329           One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
330           At my poor house look to behold this night
331           Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
332           Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
333           When well apparell'd April on the heel
334           Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
335           Among fresh female buds shall you this night
336           Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
337           And like her most whose merit most shall be;
338           Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
339           May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
340           Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
341           sirrah, trudge about
342           Through fair Verona; find those persons out
343           Whose names are written there, and to them say,
344           My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
345                                            Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].

346         Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
347           that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
348           with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
349           with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
350           here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
351           hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!

352                          Enter Benvolio and Romeo.


353         Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
354           One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
355           Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
356           One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
357           Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
358           And the rank poison of the old will die.

359         Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

360         Ben. For what, I pray thee?

361         Rom. For your broken shin.

362         Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

363         Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
364           Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
365           Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.

366         Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

367         Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

368         Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
369           you read anything you see?

370         Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.

371         Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!

372         Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.

373             'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
374             County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
375             The lady widow of Vitruvio;
376             Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
377             Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
378             Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
379             My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
380             Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
381             Lucio and the lively Helena.'

382           [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
383           come?

384         Serv. Up.

385         Rom. Whither?

386         Serv. To supper, to our house.

387         Rom. Whose house?

388         Serv. My master's.

389         Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.

390         Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
391           rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
392           come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.

393         Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
394           Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
395           With all the admired beauties of Verona.
396           Go thither, and with unattainted eye
397           Compare her face with some that I shall show,
398           And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

399         Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
400           Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
401           And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
402           Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
403           One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
404           Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

405         Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
406           Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
407           But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
408           Your lady's love against some other maid
409           That I will show you shining at this feast,
410           And she shall scant show well that now seems best.

411         Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
412           But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]




413       Scene III.
414       Capulet's house.

415       Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.


416         Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.

417         Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
418           I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
419           God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

420                                Enter Juliet.


421         Jul. How now? Who calls?

422         Nurse. Your mother.

423         Jul. Madam, I am here.
424           What is your will?

425         Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
426           We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
427           I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
428           Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

429         Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

430         Wife. She's not fourteen.

431         Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
432           And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
433           She is not fourteen. How long is it now
434           To Lammastide?

435         Wife. A fortnight and odd days.

436         Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
437           Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
438           Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
439           Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
440           She was too good for me. But, as I said,
441           On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
442           That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
443           'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
444           And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
445           Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
446           For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
447           Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
448           My lord and you were then at Mantua.
449           Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
450           When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
451           Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
452           To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
453           Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
454           To bid me trudge.
455           And since that time it is eleven years,
456           For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
457           She could have run and waddled all about;
458           For even the day before, she broke her brow;
459           And then my husband (God be with his soul!
460           'A was a merry man) took up the child.
461           'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
462           Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
463           Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
464           The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
465           To see now how a jest shall come about!
466           I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
467           I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
468           And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'

469         Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.

470         Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
471           To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
472           And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
473           A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
474           A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
475           'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
476           Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
477           Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'

478         Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

479         Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
480           Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
481           An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.

482         Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
483           I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
484           How stands your disposition to be married?

485         Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.

486         Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
487           I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

488         Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
489           Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
490           Are made already mothers. By my count,
491           I was your mother much upon these years
492           That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
493           The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

494         Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
495           As all the world- why he's a man of wax.

496         Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

497         Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.

498         Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
499           This night you shall behold him at our feast.
500           Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
501           And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
502           Examine every married lineament,
503           And see how one another lends content;
504           And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
505           Find written in the margent of his eyes,
506           This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
507           To beautify him only lacks a cover.
508           The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
509           For fair without the fair within to hide.
510           That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
511           That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
512           So shall you share all that he doth possess,
513           By having him making yourself no less.

514         Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men

515         Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

516         Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
517           But no more deep will I endart mine eye
518           Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

519                               Enter Servingman.


520         Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
521           my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
522           everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
523           follow straight.

524         Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
525           Juliet, the County stays.

526         Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
527                                                                Exeunt.




528       Scene IV.
529       A street.

530       Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
531       Torchbearers.


532         Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
533           Or shall we on without apology?

534         Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
535           We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
536           Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
537           Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
538           Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
539           After the prompter, for our entrance;
540           But, let them measure us by what they will,
541           We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

542         Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
543           Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

544         Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

545         Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
546           With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
547           So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

548         Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
549           And soar with them above a common bound.

550         Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
551           To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
552           I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
553           Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.

554         Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
555           Too great oppression for a tender thing.

556         Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
557           Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.

558         Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
559           Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
560           Give me a case to put my visage in.
561           A visor for a visor! What care I
562           What curious eye doth quote deformities?
563           Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

564         Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
565           But every man betake him to his legs.

566         Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
567           Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
568           For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
569           I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
570           The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

571         Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
572           If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
573           Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
574           Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

575         Rom. Nay, that's not so.

576         Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
577           We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
578           Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
579           Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

580         Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
581           But 'tis no wit to go.

582         Mer. Why, may one ask?

583         Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.

584         Mer. And so did I.

585         Rom. Well, what was yours?

586         Mer. That dreamers often lie.

587         Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

588         Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
589           She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
590           In shape no bigger than an agate stone
591           On the forefinger of an alderman,
592           Drawn with a team of little atomies
593           Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
594           Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
595           The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
596           Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
597           Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
598           Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
599           Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
600           Not half so big as a round little worm
601           Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
602           Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
603           Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
604           Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
605           And in this state she 'gallops night by night
606           Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
607           O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
608           O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
609           O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
610           Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
611           Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
612           Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
613           And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
614           And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
615           Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
616           Then dreams he of another benefice.
617           Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
618           And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
619           Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
620           Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
621           Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
622           And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
623           And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
624           That plats the manes of horses in the night
625           And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
626           Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
627           This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
628           That presses them and learns them first to bear,
629           Making them women of good carriage.
630           This is she-

631         Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
632           Thou talk'st of nothing.

633         Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
634           Which are the children of an idle brain,
635           Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
636           Which is as thin of substance as the air,
637           And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
638           Even now the frozen bosom of the North
639           And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
640           Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.

641         Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
642           Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

643         Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
644           Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
645           Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
646           With this night's revels and expire the term
647           Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
648           By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
649           But he that hath the steerage of my course
650           Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!

651         Ben. Strike, drum.
652                                  They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]




653       Scene V.
654       Capulet's house.

655       Servingmen come forth with napkins.

656         1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
657           He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
658         2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
659           hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
660         1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
661           look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
662           thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
663       Nell.
664           Anthony, and Potpan!
665         2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
666         1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
667           sought for, in the great chamber.
668         3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
669           Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.

670           Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
671                     Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
672                      and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.


673         Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
674           Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
675           Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
676           Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
677           She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
678           Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
679           That I have worn a visor and could tell
680           A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
681           Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
682           You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
683           A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
684                                           Music plays, and they dance.
685           More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
686           And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
687           Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
688           Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
689           For you and I are past our dancing days.
690           How long is't now since last yourself and I
691           Were in a mask?
692         2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.

693         Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
694           'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
695           Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
696           Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
697         2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
698           His son is thirty.

699         Cap. Will you tell me that?
700           His son was but a ward two years ago.

701         Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
702           hand Of yonder knight?

703         Serv. I know not, sir.

704         Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
705           It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
706           Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
707           Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
708           So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
709           As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
710           The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
711           And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
712           Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
713           For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

714         Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
715           Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
716           Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
717           To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
718           Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
719           To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

720         Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?

721         Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
722           A villain, that is hither come in spite
723           To scorn at our solemnity this night.

724         Cap. Young Romeo is it?

725         Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

726         Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
727           'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
728           And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
729           To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
730           I would not for the wealth of all this town
731           Here in my house do him disparagement.
732           Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
733           It is my will; the which if thou respect,
734           Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
735           An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

736         Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
737           I'll not endure him.

738         Cap. He shall be endur'd.
739           What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
740           Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
741           You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
742           You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
743           You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

744         Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

745         Cap. Go to, go to!
746           You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
747           This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
748           You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
749           Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
750           Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
751           I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!

752         Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
753           Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
754           I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
755           Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.

756         Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
757           This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
758           My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
759           To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

760         Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
761           Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
762           For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
763           And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

764         Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

765         Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.

766         Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
767           They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

768         Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

769         Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
770           Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]

771         Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

772         Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
773           Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]

774         Jul. You kiss by th' book.

775         Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

776         Rom. What is her mother?

777         Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
778           Her mother is the lady of the house.
779           And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
780           I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
781           I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
782           Shall have the chinks.

783         Rom. Is she a Capulet?
784           O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

785         Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

786         Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

787         Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
788           We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
789           Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
790           I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
791           More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
792           Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
793           I'll to my rest.
794                                     Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].

795         Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

796         Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.

797         Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?

798         Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.

799         Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

800         Nurse. I know not.

801         Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
802           My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

803         Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
804           The only son of your great enemy.

805         Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
806           Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
807           Prodigious birth of love it is to me
808           That I must love a loathed enemy.

809         Nurse. What's this? what's this?

810         Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
811           Of one I danc'd withal.
812                                            One calls within, 'Juliet.'

813         Nurse. Anon, anon!
814           Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.




815       PROLOGUE

816       Enter Chorus.


817         Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
818           And young affection gapes to be his heir;
819           That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
820           With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
821           Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
822           Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
823           But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
824           And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
825           Being held a foe, he may not have access
826           To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
827           And she as much in love, her means much less
828           To meet her new beloved anywhere;
829           But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
830           Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
831       Exit.




832       ACT II. Scene I.
833       A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.

834       Enter Romeo alone.


835         Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
836           Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
837                            [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]

838                          Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.


839         Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!

840         Mer. He is wise,
841           And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.

842         Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
843           Call, good Mercutio.

844         Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
845           Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
846           Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
847           Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
848           Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
849           Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
850           One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
851           Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
852           When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
853           He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
854           The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
855           I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
856           By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
857           By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
858           And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
859           That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

860         Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

861         Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
862           To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
863           Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
864           Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
865           That were some spite; my invocation
866           Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
867           I conjure only but to raise up him.

868         Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
869           To be consorted with the humorous night.
870           Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

871         Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
872           Now will he sit under a medlar tree
873           And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
874           As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
875           O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
876           An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
877           Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
878           This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
879           Come, shall we go?

880         Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
881           'To seek him here that means not to be found.
882                                                                Exeunt.




883       Scene II.
884       Capulet's orchard.

885       Enter Romeo.


886         Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

887                            Enter Juliet above at a window.

888           But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
889           It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
890           Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
891           Who is already sick and pale with grief
892           That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
893           Be not her maid, since she is envious.
894           Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
895           And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
896           It is my lady; O, it is my love!
897           O that she knew she were!
898           She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
899           Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
900           I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
901           Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
902           Having some business, do entreat her eyes
903           To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
904           What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
905           The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
906           As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
907           Would through the airy region stream so bright
908           That birds would sing and think it were not night.
909           See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
910           O that I were a glove upon that hand,
911           That I might touch that cheek!

912         Jul. Ay me!

913         Rom. She speaks.
914           O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
915           As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
916           As is a winged messenger of heaven
917           Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
918           Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
919           When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
920           And sails upon the bosom of the air.

921         Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
922           Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
923           Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
924           And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

925         Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

926         Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
927           Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
928           What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
929           Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
930           Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
931           What's in a name? That which we call a rose
932           By any other name would smell as sweet.
933           So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
934           Retain that dear perfection which he owes
935           Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
936           And for that name, which is no part of thee,
937           Take all myself.

938         Rom. I take thee at thy word.
939           Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
940           Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

941         Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
942           So stumblest on my counsel?

943         Rom. By a name
944           I know not how to tell thee who I am.
945           My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
946           Because it is an enemy to thee.
947           Had I it written, I would tear the word.

948         Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
949           Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
950           Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

951         Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

952         Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
953           The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
954           And the place death, considering who thou art,
955           If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

956         Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
957           For stony limits cannot hold love out,
958           And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
959           Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

960         Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.

961         Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
962           Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
963           And I am proof against their enmity.

964         Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.

965         Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
966           And but thou love me, let them find me here.
967           My life were better ended by their hate
968           Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

969         Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

970         Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
971           He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
972           I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
973           As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
974           I would adventure for such merchandise.

975         Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
976           Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
977           For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
978           Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
979           What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
980           Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
981           And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
982           Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
983           They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
984           If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
985           Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
986           I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
987           So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
988           In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
989           And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
990           But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
991           Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
992           I should have been more strange, I must confess,
993           But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
994           My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
995           And not impute this yielding to light love,
996           Which the dark night hath so discovered.

997         Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
998           That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-

999         Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
1000          That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1001          Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

1002        Rom. What shall I swear by?

1003        Jul. Do not swear at all;
1004          Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1005          Which is the god of my idolatry,
1006          And I'll believe thee.

1007        Rom. If my heart's dear love-

1008        Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
1009          I have no joy of this contract to-night.
1010          It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
1011          Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1012          Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1013          This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1014          May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
1015          Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
1016          Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

1017        Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

1018        Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

1019        Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

1020        Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
1021          And yet I would it were to give again.

1022        Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

1023        Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
1024          And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
1025          My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1026          My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1027          The more I have, for both are infinite.
1028          I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
1029                                                 [Nurse] calls within.
1030          Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1031          Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]

1032        Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
1033          Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1034          Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

1035                             Enter Juliet above.


1036        Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1037          If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1038          Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1039          By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1040          Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1041          And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1042          And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

1043        Nurse. (within) Madam!

1044        Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
1045          I do beseech thee-

1046        Nurse. (within) Madam!

1047        Jul. By-and-by I come.-
1048          To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
1049          To-morrow will I send.

1050        Rom. So thrive my soul-

1051        Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.

1052        Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
1053          Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
1054          But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.

1055                           Enter Juliet again, [above].


1056        Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
1057          To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1058          Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
1059          Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1060          And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
1061          With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1062          Romeo!

1063        Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
1064          How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1065          Like softest music to attending ears!

1066        Jul. Romeo!

1067        Rom. My dear?

1068        Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
1069          Shall I send to thee?

1070        Rom. By the hour of nine.

1071        Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
1072          I have forgot why I did call thee back.

1073        Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.

1074        Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1075          Rememb'ring how I love thy company.

1076        Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1077          Forgetting any other home but this.

1078        Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
1079          And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
1080          That lets it hop a little from her hand,
1081          Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1082          And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1083          So loving-jealous of his liberty.

1084        Rom. I would I were thy bird.

1085        Jul. Sweet, so would I.
1086          Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1087          Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
1088          That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1089                                                               [Exit.]

1090        Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1091          Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1092          Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1093          His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
1094       Exit




1095      Scene III.
1096      Friar Laurence's cell.

1097      Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.


1098        Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
1099          Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
1100          And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1101          From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
1102          Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
1103          The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1104          I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1105          With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1106          The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
1107          What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
1108          And from her womb children of divers kind
1109          We sucking on her natural bosom find;
1110          Many for many virtues excellent,
1111          None but for some, and yet all different.
1112          O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1113          In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
1114          For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
1115          But to the earth some special good doth give;
1116          Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
1117          Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
1118          Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
1119          And vice sometime's by action dignified.
1120          Within the infant rind of this small flower
1121          Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
1122          For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1123          Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1124          Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1125          In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
1126          And where the worser is predominant,
1127          Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

1128                              Enter Romeo.


1129        Rom. Good morrow, father.

1130        Friar. Benedicite!
1131          What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1132          Young son, it argues a distempered head
1133          So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
1134          Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1135          And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
1136          But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1137          Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
1138          Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1139          Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
1140          Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
1141          Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

1142        Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

1143        Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

1144        Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
1145          I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

1146        Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?

1147        Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
1148          I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1149          Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
1150          That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
1151          Within thy help and holy physic lies.
1152          I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1153          My intercession likewise steads my foe.

1154        Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
1155          Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

1156        Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1157          On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
1158          As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
1159          And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
1160          By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
1161          We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
1162          I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1163          That thou consent to marry us to-day.

1164        Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
1165          Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
1166          So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
1167          Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1168          Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
1169          Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1170          How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1171          To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1172          The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1173          Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
1174          Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1175          Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
1176          If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
1177          Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
1178          And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
1179          Women may fall when there's no strength in men.

1180        Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

1181        Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

1182        Rom. And bad'st me bury love.

1183        Friar. Not in a grave
1184          To lay one in, another out to have.

1185        Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
1186          Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
1187          The other did not so.

1188        Friar. O, she knew well
1189          Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
1190          But come, young waverer, come go with me.
1191          In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1192          For this alliance may so happy prove
1193          To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

1194        Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.

1195        Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
1196                                                               Exeunt.




1197      Scene IV.
1198      A street.

1199      Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.


1200        Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1201          Came he not home to-night?

1202        Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.

1203        Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
1204          Torments him so that he will sure run mad.

1205        Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
1206          Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

1207        Mer. A challenge, on my life.

1208        Ben. Romeo will answer it.

1209        Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.

1210        Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
1211          being dared.

1212        Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
1213          wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
1214          very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
1215          butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

1216        Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?

1217        Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
1218          courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
1219          pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
1220          minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
1221          butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
1222          of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
1223          immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.

1224        Ben. The what?

1225        Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
1226          these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
1227          tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1228          grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
1229          flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
1230          so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
1231          bench? O, their bones, their bones!

1232                                     Enter Romeo.


1233        Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!

1234        Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
1235          art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
1236          flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
1237          had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
1238          Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
1239          but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
1240          salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1241          fairly last night.

1242        Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

1243        Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?

1244        Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
1245          case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

1246        Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
1247          man to bow in the hams.

1248        Rom. Meaning, to cursy.

1249        Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.

1250        Rom. A most courteous exposition.

1251        Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

1252        Rom. Pink for flower.

1253        Mer. Right.

1254        Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.

1255        Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
1256          thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
1257          remain, after the wearing, solely singular.

1258        Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!

1259        Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.

1260        Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.

1261        Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
1262          thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
1263          sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?

1264        Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
1265          there for the goose.

1266        Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

1267        Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!

1268        Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.

1269        Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?

1270        Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
1271          narrow to an ell broad!

1272        Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
1273          the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

1274        Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
1275          art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
1276          art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
1277          great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
1278          a hole.

1279        Ben. Stop there, stop there!

1280        Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

1281        Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

1282        Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
1283          was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
1284          occupy the argument no longer.

1285        Rom. Here's goodly gear!

1286                            Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].


1287        Mer. A sail, a sail!

1288        Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.

1289        Nurse. Peter!

1290        Peter. Anon.

1291        Nurse. My fan, Peter.

1292        Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
1293          the two.

1294        Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

1295        Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.

1296        Nurse. Is it good-den?

1297        Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
1298          now upon the prick of noon.

1299        Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!

1300        Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.

1301        Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
1302          quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
1303          young Romeo?

1304        Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
1305          have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
1306          of that name, for fault of a worse.

1307        Nurse. You say well.

1308        Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
1309          wisely.

1310        Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.

1311        Ben. She will endite him to some supper.

1312        Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

1313        Rom. What hast thou found?

1314        Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
1315          something stale and hoar ere it be spent
1316                                           He walks by them and sings.

1317                         An old hare hoar,
1318                         And an old hare hoar,
1319                      Is very good meat in Lent;
1320                         But a hare that is hoar
1321                         Is too much for a score
1322                      When it hoars ere it be spent.

1323          Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.

1324        Rom. I will follow you.

1325        Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
1326          [sings] lady, lady, lady.
1327                                            Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.

1328        Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
1329          was this that was so full of his ropery?

1330        Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
1331          will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

1332        Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
1333      'a
1334          were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
1335          I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
1336          flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
1337          stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!

1338        Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
1339          weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
1340          soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
1341          law on my side.

1342        Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
1343          quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
1344          my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
1345          will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
1346          her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
1347          behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
1348          therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
1349          an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

1350        Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
1351          thee-

1352        Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
1353          Lord! she will be a joyful woman.

1354        Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.

1355        Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
1356          take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

1357        Rom. Bid her devise
1358          Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1359          And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1360          Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.

1361        Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.

1362        Rom. Go to! I say you shall.

1363        Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.

1364        Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
1365          Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1366          And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
1367          Which to the high topgallant of my joy
1368          Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1369          Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
1370          Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.

1371        Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

1372        Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

1373        Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1374          Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

1375        Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.

1376        Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
1377          when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
1378          town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
1379          good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
1380          anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
1381          but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
1382          clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
1383          with a letter?

1384        Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.

1385        Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
1386          know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
1387          sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
1388          good to hear it.

1389        Rom. Commend me to thy lady.

1390        Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!

1391        Peter. Anon.

1392        Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
1393                                                               Exeunt.




1394      Scene V.
1395      Capulet's orchard.

1396      Enter Juliet.


1397        Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1398          In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
1399          Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
1400          O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
1401          Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
1402          Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
1403          Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
1404          And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1405          Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1406          Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1407          Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
1408          Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1409          She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1410          My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1411          And his to me,
1412          But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
1413          Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

1414                            Enter Nurse [and Peter].

1415          O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
1416          Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

1417        Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
1418                                                         [Exit Peter.]

1419        Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1420          Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1421          If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1422          By playing it to me with so sour a face.

1423        Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
1424          Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!

1425        Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
1426          Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.

1427        Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
1428          Do you not see that I am out of breath?

1429        Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
1430          To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1431          The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1432          Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1433          Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
1434          Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
1435          Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

1436        Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
1437          choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
1438          than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
1439          foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
1440          they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
1441          warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
1442      God.
1443          What, have you din'd at home?

1444        Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
1445          What says he of our marriage? What of that?

1446        Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
1447          It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1448          My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
1449          Beshrew your heart for sending me about
1450          To catch my death with jauncing up and down!

1451        Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1452          Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

1453        Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
1454          and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
1455          is your mother?

1456        Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
1457          Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1458          'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1459          "Where is your mother?"'

1460        Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
1461          Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
1462          Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1463          Henceforward do your messages yourself.

1464        Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?

1465        Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

1466        Jul. I have.

1467        Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1468          There stays a husband to make you a wife.
1469          Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
1470          They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1471          Hie you to church; I must another way,
1472          To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1473          Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
1474          I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
1475          But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
1476          Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

1477        Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
1478                                                               Exeunt.




1479      Scene VI.
1480      Friar Laurence's cell.

1481      Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.


1482        Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
1483          That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!

1484        Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
1485          It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1486          That one short minute gives me in her sight.
1487          Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1488          Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
1489          It is enough I may but call her mine.

1490        Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
1491          And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1492          Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
1493          Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1494          And in the taste confounds the appetite.
1495          Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
1496          Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

1497                           Enter Juliet.

1498          Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
1499          Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
1500          A lover may bestride the gossamer
1501          That idles in the wanton summer air,
1502          And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

1503        Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.

1504        Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

1505        Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

1506        Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
1507          Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
1508          To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
1509          This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1510          Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
1511          Receive in either by this dear encounter.

1512        Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
1513          Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
1514          They are but beggars that can count their worth;
1515          But my true love is grown to such excess
1516          cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

1517        Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
1518          For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
1519          Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
1520                                                             [Exeunt.]




1521      ACT III. Scene I.
1522      A public place.

1523      Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.


1524        Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
1525          The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
1526          And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
1527          For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

1528        Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
1529          the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
1530          says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
1531          second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

1532        Ben. Am I like such a fellow?

1533        Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
1534          Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
1535          moved.

1536        Ben. And what to?

1537        Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
1538          for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
1539          man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
1540          Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
1541          other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
1542          eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
1543          as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
1544          addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
1545          man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
1546          that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
1547          tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
1548          another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
1549          tutor me from quarrelling!

1550        Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
1551          buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

1552        Mer. The fee simple? O simple!

1553                             Enter Tybalt and others.


1554        Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.

1555        Mer. By my heel, I care not.

1556        Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
1557          Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.

1558        Mer. And but one word with one of us?
1559          Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

1560        Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
1561          occasion.

1562        Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving

1563        Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

1564        Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
1565          minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
1566          fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!

1567        Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
1568          Either withdraw unto some private place
1569          And reason coldly of your grievances,
1570          Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.

1571        Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
1572          I will not budge for no man's pleasure,

1573                              Enter Romeo.


1574        Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

1575        Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
1576          Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
1577          Your worship in that sense may call him man.

1578        Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
1579          No better term than this: thou art a villain.

1580        Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
1581          Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
1582          To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
1583          Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.

1584        Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
1585          That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

1586        Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
1587          But love thee better than thou canst devise
1588          Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
1589          And so good Capulet, which name I tender
1590          As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

1591        Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
1592          Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
1593          Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?

1594        Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?

1595        Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
1596      That I
1597          mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,

1598          dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
1599          of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
1600          ears ere it be out.

1601        Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]

1602        Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

1603        Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
1604                                                         [They fight.]

1605        Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
1606          Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
1607          Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
1608          Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
1609          Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
1610               Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
1611                                                 [with his Followers].

1612        Mer. I am hurt.
1613          A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
1614          Is he gone and hath nothing?

1615        Ben. What, art thou hurt?

1616        Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
1617          Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
1618                                                          [Exit Page.]

1619        Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

1620        Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
1621          but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
1622          shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
1623          world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
1624          mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
1625      a
1626          villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
1627          came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.

1628        Rom. I thought all for the best.

1629        Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
1630          Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
1631          They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
1632          And soundly too. Your houses!
1633                                       [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].

1634        Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
1635          My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
1636          In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
1637          With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
1638          Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
1639          Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
1640          And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel

1641                            Enter Benvolio.


1642        Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
1643          That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
1644          Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

1645        Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
1646          This but begins the woe others must end.

1647                             Enter Tybalt.


1648        Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

1649        Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
1650          Away to heaven respective lenity,
1651          And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
1652          Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
1653          That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
1654          Is but a little way above our heads,
1655          Staying for thine to keep him company.
1656          Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.

1657        Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
1658          Shalt with him hence.

1659        Rom. This shall determine that.
1660                                             They fight. Tybalt falls.

1661        Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
1662          The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
1663          Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
1664          If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

1665        Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!

1666        Ben. Why dost thou stay?
1667                                                           Exit Romeo.
1668                            Enter Citizens.


1669        Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
1670          Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?

1671        Ben. There lies that Tybalt.

1672        Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
1673          I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.


1674        Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
1675                           and [others].


1676        Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

1677        Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
1678          The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
1679          There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
1680          That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

1681        Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
1682          O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
1683          Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
1684          For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
1685          O cousin, cousin!

1686        Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

1687        Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
1688          Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
1689          How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
1690          Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
1691          With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
1692          Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
1693          Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
1694          With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
1695          Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
1696          And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
1697          Cold death aside and with the other sends
1698          It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
1699          Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
1700          'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
1701          His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
1702          And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
1703          An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
1704          Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
1705          But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
1706          Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
1707          And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
1708          Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
1709          And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
1710          This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

1711        Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
1712          Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
1713          Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
1714          And all those twenty could but kill one life.
1715          I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
1716          Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.

1717        Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
1718          Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

1719        Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
1720          His fault concludes but what the law should end,
1721          The life of Tybalt.

1722        Prince. And for that offence
1723          Immediately we do exile him hence.
1724          I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
1725          My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
1726          But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
1727          That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
1728          I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
1729          Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
1730          Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
1731          Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
1732          Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
1733          Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
1734                                                               Exeunt.




1735      Scene II.
1736      Capulet's orchard.

1737      Enter Juliet alone.


1738        Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
1739          Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
1740          As Phaeton would whip you to the West
1741          And bring in cloudy night immediately.
1742          Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
1743          That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
1744          Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
1745          Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
1746          By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
1747          It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
1748          Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
1749          And learn me how to lose a winning match,
1750          Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
1751          Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
1752          With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
1753          Think true love acted simple modesty.
1754          Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
1755          For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
1756          Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
1757          Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
1758          Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
1759          Take him and cut him out in little stars,
1760          And he will make the face of heaven so fine
1761          That all the world will be in love with night
1762          And pay no worship to the garish sun.
1763          O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
1764          But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
1765          Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
1766          As is the night before some festival
1767          To an impatient child that hath new robes
1768          And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,

1769                      Enter Nurse, with cords.

1770          And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
1771          But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
1772          Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
1773          That Romeo bid thee fetch?

1774        Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
1775                                                   [Throws them down.]

1776        Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands

1777        Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
1778          We are undone, lady, we are undone!
1779          Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

1780        Jul. Can heaven be so envious?

1781        Nurse. Romeo can,
1782          Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
1783          Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

1784        Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
1785          This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
1786          Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
1787          And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
1788          Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
1789          I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
1790          Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
1791          If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
1792          Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

1793        Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
1794          (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
1795          A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
1796          Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
1797          All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.

1798        Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
1799          To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
1800          Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
1801          And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

1802        Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
1803          O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
1804          That ever I should live to see thee dead!

1805        Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
1806          Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
1807          My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
1808          Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
1809          For who is living, if those two are gone?

1810        Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
1811          Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

1812        Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

1813        Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!

1814        Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
1815          Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
1816          Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
1817          Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
1818          Despised substance of divinest show!
1819          Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
1820          A damned saint, an honourable villain!
1821          O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
1822          When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
1823          In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
1824          Was ever book containing such vile matter
1825          So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
1826          In such a gorgeous palace!

1827        Nurse. There's no trust,
1828          No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
1829          All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
1830          Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
1831          These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
1832          Shame come to Romeo!

1833        Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
1834          For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
1835          Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
1836          For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
1837          Sole monarch of the universal earth.
1838          O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

1839        Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

1840        Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
1841          Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
1842          When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
1843          But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
1844          That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
1845          Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
1846          Your tributary drops belong to woe,
1847          Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
1848          My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
1849          And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
1850          All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
1851          Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
1852          That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
1853          But O, it presses to my memory
1854          Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
1855          'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
1856          That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
1857          Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
1858          Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
1859          Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
1860          And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
1861          Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
1862          Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
1863          Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
1864          But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
1865          'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
1866          Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
1867          All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
1868          There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
1869          In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
1870          Where is my father and my mother, nurse?

1871        Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
1872          Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

1873        Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
1874          When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
1875          Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
1876          Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
1877          He made you for a highway to my bed;
1878          But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
1879          Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
1880          And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

1881        Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
1882          To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
1883          Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
1884          I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

1885        Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
1886          And bid him come to take his last farewell.
1887                                                               Exeunt.




1888      Scene III.
1889      Friar Laurence's cell.

1890      Enter Friar [Laurence].


1891        Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
1892          Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
1893          And thou art wedded to calamity.

1894                               Enter Romeo.


1895        Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
1896          What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
1897          That I yet know not?

1898        Friar. Too familiar
1899          Is my dear son with such sour company.
1900          I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.

1901        Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?

1902        Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
1903          Not body's death, but body's banishment.

1904        Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
1905          For exile hath more terror in his look,
1906          Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'

1907        Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
1908          Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

1909        Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
1910          But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
1911          Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
1912          And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
1913          Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
1914          Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
1915          And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

1916        Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
1917          Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
1918          Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
1919          And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
1920          This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

1921        Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
1922          Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
1923          And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
1924          Live here in heaven and may look on her;
1925          But Romeo may not. More validity,
1926          More honourable state, more courtship lives
1927          In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
1928          On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
1929          And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
1930          Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
1931          Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
1932          But Romeo may not- he is banished.
1933          This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
1934          They are free men, but I am banished.
1935          And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
1936          Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
1937          No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
1938          But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
1939          O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
1940          Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
1941          Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
1942          A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
1943          To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

1944        Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.

1945        Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

1946        Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
1947          Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
1948          To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

1949        Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
1950          Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
1951          Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
1952          It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.

1953        Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

1954        Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

1955        Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

1956        Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
1957          Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
1958          An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
1959          Doting like me, and like me banished,
1960          Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
1961          And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
1962          Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
1963                                                       Knock [within].

1964        Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

1965        Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
1966          Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.

1967        Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
1968          Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
1969          Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
1970          What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
1971          Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will

1972        Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
1973          I come from Lady Juliet.

1974        Friar. Welcome then.

1975                             Enter Nurse.


1976        Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
1977          Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

1978        Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

1979        Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
1980          Just in her case!

1981        Friar. O woeful sympathy!
1982          Piteous predicament!

1983        Nurse. Even so lies she,
1984          Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
1985          Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
1986          For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
1987          Why should you fall into so deep an O?

1988        Rom. (rises) Nurse-

1989        Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

1990        Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
1991          Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
1992          Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
1993          With blood remov'd but little from her own?
1994          Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
1995          My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

1996        Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
1997          And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
1998          And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
1999          And then down falls again.

2000        Rom. As if that name,
2001          Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2002          Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
2003          Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2004          In what vile part of this anatomy
2005          Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
2006          The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]

2007        Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
2008          Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
2009          Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
2010          The unreasonable fury of a beast.
2011          Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2012          Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2013          Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
2014          I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2015          Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
2016          And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
2017          By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2018          Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2019          Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
2020          In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2021          Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
2022          Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2023          And usest none in that true use indeed
2024          Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
2025          Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
2026          Digressing from the valour of a man;
2027          Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2028          Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2029          Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2030          Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2031          Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
2032          is get afire by thine own ignorance,
2033          And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
2034          What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
2035          For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
2036          There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
2037          But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
2038          The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
2039          And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
2040          A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
2041          Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2042          But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
2043          Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
2044          Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2045          Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2046          Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
2047          But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2048          For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
2049          Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
2050          To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2051          Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
2052          With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2053          Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2054          Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
2055          And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2056          Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
2057          Romeo is coming.

2058        Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2059          To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
2060          My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

2061        Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

2062        Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
2063          Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.

2064        Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!

2065        Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2066          Either be gone before the watch be set,
2067          Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
2068          Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
2069          And he shall signify from time to time
2070          Every good hap to you that chances here.
2071          Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.

2072        Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2073          It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
2074          Farewell.
2075                                                               Exeunt.




2076      Scene IV.
2077      Capulet's house

2078      Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.


2079        Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
2080          That we have had no time to move our daughter.
2081          Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2082          And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
2083          'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
2084          I promise you, but for your company,
2085          I would have been abed an hour ago.

2086        Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
2087          Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.

2088        Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2089          To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.

2090        Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2091          Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
2092          In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
2093          Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2094          Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
2095          And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
2096          But, soft! what day is this?

2097        Par. Monday, my lord.

2098        Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
2099          Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
2100          She shall be married to this noble earl.
2101          Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
2102          We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
2103          For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2104          It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2105          Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
2106          Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2107          And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

2108        Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

2109        Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
2110          Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
2111          Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
2112          Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
2113          Afore me, It is so very very late
2114          That we may call it early by-and-by.
2115          Good night.
2116                                                                Exeunt




2117      Scene V.
2118      Capulet's orchard.

2119      Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.


2120        Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
2121          It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2122          That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
2123          Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
2124          Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

2125        Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
2126          No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
2127          Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
2128          Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2129          Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2130          I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

2131        Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
2132          It is some meteor that the sun exhales
2133          To be to thee this night a torchbearer
2134          And light thee on the way to Mantua.
2135          Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

2136        Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
2137          I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2138          I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2139          'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2140          Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
2141          The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
2142          I have more care to stay than will to go.
2143          Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2144          How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.

2145        Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
2146          It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2147          Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2148          Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2149          This doth not so, for she divideth us.
2150          Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
2151          O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
2152          Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2153          Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
2154          O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.

2155        Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!

2156                                Enter Nurse.


2157        Nurse. Madam!

2158        Jul. Nurse?

2159        Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
2160          The day is broke; be wary, look about.

2161        Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2162                                                               [Exit.]

2163        Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
2164                                                        He goeth down.

2165        Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
2166          I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2167          For in a minute there are many days.
2168          O, by this count I shall be much in years
2169          Ere I again behold my Romeo!

2170        Rom. Farewell!
2171          I will omit no opportunity
2172          That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

2173        Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

2174        Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2175          For sweet discourses in our time to come.

2176        Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2177          Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2178          As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
2179          Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

2180        Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
2181          Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2182      Exit.

2183        Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
2184          If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
2185          That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
2186          For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
2187          But send him back.

2188        Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?

2189        Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
2190          Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2191          What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

2192                             Enter Mother.


2193        Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?

2194        Jul. Madam, I am not well.

2195        Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2196          What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2197          An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
2198          Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
2199          But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

2200        Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

2201        Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2202          Which you weep for.

2203        Jul. Feeling so the loss,
2204          I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

2205        Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
2206          As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

2207        Jul. What villain, madam?

2208        Lady. That same villain Romeo.

2209        Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
2210          God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2211          And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

2212        Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.

2213        Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
2214          Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

2215        Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
2216          Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2217          Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2218          Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
2219          That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
2220          And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.

2221        Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
2222          With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
2223          Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
2224          Madam, if you could find out but a man
2225          To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2226          That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2227          Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2228          To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
2229          To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
2230          Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!

2231        Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2232          But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

2233        Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
2234          What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

2235        Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2236          One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2237          Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
2238          That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.

2239        Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?

2240        Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
2241          The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
2242          The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2243          Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

2244        Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
2245          He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
2246          I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
2247          Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
2248          I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
2249          I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
2250          It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2251          Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

2252        Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
2253          And see how he will take it at your hands.

2254                         Enter Capulet and Nurse.


2255        Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
2256          But for the sunset of my brother's son
2257          It rains downright.
2258          How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
2259          Evermore show'ring? In one little body
2260          Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
2261          For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2262          Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
2263          Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
2264          Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
2265          Without a sudden calm will overset
2266          Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
2267          Have you delivered to her our decree?

2268        Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2269          I would the fool were married to her grave!

2270        Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2271          How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
2272          Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
2273          Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2274          So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

2275        Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
2276          Proud can I never be of what I hate,
2277          But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

2278        Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
2279          'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
2280          And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
2281          Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
2282          But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
2283          To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2284          Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2285          Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
2286          You tallow-face!

2287        Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

2288        Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2289          Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

2290        Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2291          I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
2292          Or never after look me in the face.
2293          Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
2294          My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2295          That God had lent us but this only child;
2296          But now I see this one is one too much,
2297          And that we have a curse in having her.
2298          Out on her, hilding!

2299        Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
2300          You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

2301        Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
2302          Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!

2303        Nurse. I speak no treason.

2304        Cap. O, God-i-god-en!

2305        Nurse. May not one speak?

2306        Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
2307          Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
2308          For here we need it not.

2309        Lady. You are too hot.

2310        Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
2311          At home, abroad, alone, in company,
2312          Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
2313          To have her match'd; and having now provided
2314          A gentleman of princely parentage,
2315          Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2316          Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2317          Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
2318          And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2319          A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2320          To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
2321          I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
2322          But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
2323          Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
2324          Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
2325          Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2326          An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2327          An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
2328          For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2329          Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
2330          Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.

2331        Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
2332          That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2333          O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2334          Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2335          Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
2336          In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

2337        Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
2338          Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.

2339        Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2340          My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
2341          How shall that faith return again to earth
2342          Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2343          By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
2344          Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2345          Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2346          What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
2347          Some comfort, nurse.

2348        Nurse. Faith, here it is.
2349          Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
2350          That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2351          Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2352          Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2353          I think it best you married with the County.
2354          O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2355          Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
2356          Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2357          As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2358          I think you are happy in this second match,
2359          For it excels your first; or if it did not,
2360          Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
2361          As living here and you no use of him.

2362        Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?

2363        Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.

2364        Jul. Amen!

2365        Nurse. What?

2366        Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
2367          Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
2368          Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
2369          To make confession and to be absolv'd.

2370        Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.

2371        Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
2372          Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
2373          Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
2374          Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
2375          So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
2376          Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
2377          I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
2378          If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.




2379      ACT IV. Scene I.
2380      Friar Laurence's cell.

2381      Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.


2382        Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.

2383        Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
2384          And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

2385        Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
2386          Uneven is the course; I like it not.

2387        Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
2388          And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
2389          For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
2390          Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
2391          That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
2392          And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
2393          To stop the inundation of her tears,
2394          Which, too much minded by herself alone,
2395          May be put from her by society.
2396          Now do you know the reason of this haste.

2397        Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
2398          Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

2399                          Enter Juliet.


2400        Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!

2401        Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

2402        Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

2403        Jul. What must be shall be.

2404        Friar. That's a certain text.

2405        Par. Come you to make confession to this father?

2406        Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.

2407        Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.

2408        Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.

2409        Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

2410        Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
2411          Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

2412        Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.

2413        Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
2414          For it was bad enough before their spite.

2415        Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.

2416        Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
2417          And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

2418        Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.

2419        Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
2420          Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
2421          Or shall I come to you at evening mass

2422        Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
2423          My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

2424        Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
2425          Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
2426          Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.

2427        Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
2428          Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!

2429        Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
2430          It strains me past the compass of my wits.
2431          I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
2432          On Thursday next be married to this County.

2433        Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
2434          Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
2435          If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
2436          Do thou but call my resolution wise
2437          And with this knife I'll help it presently.
2438          God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
2439          And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
2440          Shall be the label to another deed,
2441          Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
2442          Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
2443          Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
2444          Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
2445          'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
2446          Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
2447          Which the commission of thy years and art
2448          Could to no issue of true honour bring.
2449          Be not so long to speak. I long to die
2450          If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

2451        Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
2452          Which craves as desperate an execution
2453          As that is desperate which we would prevent.
2454          If, rather than to marry County Paris
2455          Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
2456          Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
2457          A thing like death to chide away this shame,
2458          That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
2459          And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.

2460        Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
2461          From off the battlements of yonder tower,
2462          Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
2463          Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
2464          Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
2465          O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
2466          With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
2467          Or bid me go into a new-made grave
2468          And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
2469          Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
2470          And I will do it without fear or doubt,
2471          To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

2472        Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
2473          To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
2474          To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
2475          Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
2476          Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
2477          And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
2478          When presently through all thy veins shall run
2479          A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
2480          Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
2481          No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
2482          The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
2483          To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
2484          Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
2485          Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
2486          Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
2487          And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
2488          Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
2489          And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
2490          Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
2491          To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
2492          Then, as the manner of our country is,
2493          In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
2494          Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
2495          Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
2496          In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
2497          Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
2498          And hither shall he come; and he and I
2499          Will watch thy waking, and that very night
2500          Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
2501          And this shall free thee from this present shame,
2502          If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
2503          Abate thy valour in the acting it.

2504        Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

2505        Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
2506          In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
2507          To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

2508        Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
2509          Farewell, dear father.
2510                                                               Exeunt.




2511      Scene II.
2512      Capulet's house.

2513      Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
2514                              two or three.


2515        Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
2516                                                  [Exit a Servingman.]
2517          Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

2518        Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
2519          lick their fingers.

2520        Cap. How canst thou try them so?

2521        Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
2522          fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
2523          with me.

2524        Cap. Go, begone.
2525                                                      Exit Servingman.
2526          We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
2527          What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

2528        Nurse. Ay, forsooth.

2529        Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
2530          A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

2531                              Enter Juliet.


2532        Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

2533        Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?

2534        Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
2535          Of disobedient opposition
2536          To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
2537          By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
2538          To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
2539          Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.

2540        Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
2541          I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

2542        Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
2543          And gave him what becomed love I might,
2544          Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

2545        Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
2546          This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
2547          Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
2548          Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
2549          All our whole city is much bound to him.

2550        Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
2551          To help me sort such needful ornaments
2552          As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

2553        Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.

2554        Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
2555                                              Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.

2556        Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
2557          'Tis now near night.

2558        Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
2559          And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
2560          Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
2561          I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
2562          I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
2563          They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
2564          To County Paris, to prepare him up
2565          Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
2566          Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
2567                                                               Exeunt.




2568      Scene III.
2569      Juliet's chamber.

2570      Enter Juliet and Nurse.


2571        Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
2572          I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
2573          For I have need of many orisons
2574          To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
2575          Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.

2576                                Enter Mother.


2577        Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?

2578        Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
2579          As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
2580          So please you, let me now be left alone,
2581          And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
2582          For I am sure you have your hands full all
2583          In this so sudden business.

2584        Mother. Good night.
2585          Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
2586                                            Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]

2587        Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
2588          I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
2589          That almost freezes up the heat of life.
2590          I'll call them back again to comfort me.
2591          Nurse!- What should she do here?
2592          My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
2593          Come, vial.
2594          What if this mixture do not work at all?
2595          Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
2596          No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
2597                                                   Lays down a dagger.
2598          What if it be a poison which the friar
2599          Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
2600          Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
2601          Because he married me before to Romeo?
2602          I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
2603          For he hath still been tried a holy man.
2604          I will not entertain so bad a thought.
2605          How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
2606          I wake before the time that Romeo
2607          Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
2608          Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
2609          To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
2610          And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
2611          Or, if I live, is it not very like
2612          The horrible conceit of death and night,
2613          Together with the terror of the place-
2614          As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
2615          Where for this many hundred years the bones
2616          Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
2617          Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
2618          Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
2619          At some hours in the night spirits resort-
2620          Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
2621          So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
2622          And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
2623          That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
2624          O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
2625          Environed with all these hideous fears,
2626          And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
2627          And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
2628          And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
2629          As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
2630          O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
2631          Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
2632          Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
2633          Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

2634              She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.




2635      Scene IV.
2636      Capulet's house.

2637      Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.


2638        Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.

2639        Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

2640                             Enter Old Capulet.


2641        Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
2642          The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
2643          Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
2644          Spare not for cost.

2645        Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
2646          Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
2647          For this night's watching.

2648        Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
2649          All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

2650        Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
2651          But I will watch you from such watching now.
2652                                                Exeunt Lady and Nurse.

2653        Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!


2654        Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.

2655          What is there? Now, fellow,

2656        Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

2657        Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
2658            logs.
2659          Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.

2660        Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
2661          And never trouble Peter for the matter.

2662        Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
2663          Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
2664          The County will be here with music straight,
2665          For so he said he would.                         Play music.
2666          I hear him near.
2667          Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

2668                                    Enter Nurse.
2669          Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
2670          I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
2671          Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
2672          Make haste, I say.
2673                                                             [Exeunt.]

2675      Juliet's chamber.

2676      [Enter Nurse.]


2677        Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
2678          Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
2679          Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
2680          What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
2681          Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
2682          The County Paris hath set up his rest
2683          That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
2684          Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
2685          I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
2686          Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
2687          He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
2688                                           [Draws aside the curtains.]
2689          What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
2690          I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
2691          Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
2692          O weraday that ever I was born!
2693          Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

2694                                 Enter Mother.


2695        Mother. What noise is here?

2696        Nurse. O lamentable day!

2697        Mother. What is the matter?

2698        Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!

2699        Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
2700          Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
2701          Help, help! Call help.

2702                                  Enter Father.


2703        Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

2704        Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!

2705        Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

2706        Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
2707          Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
2708          Life and these lips have long been separated.
2709          Death lies on her like an untimely frost
2710          Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

2711        Nurse. O lamentable day!

2712        Mother. O woful time!

2713        Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
2714          Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.


2715        Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.


2716        Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

2717        Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
2718          O son, the night before thy wedding day
2719          Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
2720          Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
2721          Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
2722          My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
2723          And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.

2724        Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
2725          And doth it give me such a sight as this?

2726        Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
2727          Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
2728          In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
2729          But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
2730          But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
2731          And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!

2732        Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
2733          Most lamentable day, most woful day
2734          That ever ever I did yet behold!
2735          O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
2736          Never was seen so black a day as this.
2737          O woful day! O woful day!

2738        Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
2739          Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
2740          By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
2741          O love! O life! not life, but love in death

2742        Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
2743          Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
2744          To murther, murther our solemnity?
2745          O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
2746          Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
2747          And with my child my joys are buried!

2748        Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
2749          In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
2750          Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
2751          And all the better is it for the maid.
2752          Your part in her you could not keep from death,
2753          But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
2754          The most you sought was her promotion,
2755          For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
2756          And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
2757          Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
2758          O, in this love, you love your child so ill
2759          That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
2760          She's not well married that lives married long,
2761          But she's best married that dies married young.
2762          Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
2763          On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
2764          In all her best array bear her to church;
2765          For though fond nature bids us all lament,
2766          Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

2767        Cap. All things that we ordained festival
2768          Turn from their office to black funeral-
2769          Our instruments to melancholy bells,
2770          Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
2771          Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
2772          Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
2773          And all things change them to the contrary.

2774        Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
2775          And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
2776          To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
2777          The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
2778          Move them no more by crossing their high will.
2779                                 Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
2780        1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.

2781        Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
2782          For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
2783        1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

2784                               Enter Peter.


2785        Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
2786          O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
2787        1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',

2788        Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
2789          full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
2790        1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.

2791        Pet. You will not then?
2792        1. Mus. No.

2793        Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
2794        1. Mus. What will you give us?

2795        Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
2796           minstrel.
2797        1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.

2798        Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
2799          I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
2800          note me?
2801        1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
2802        2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

2803        Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
2804          iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.

2805                 'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
2806                   And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
2807                 Then music with her silver sound'-

2808          Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
2809          What say you, Simon Catling?
2810        1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

2811        Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
2812        2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.

2813        Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
2814        3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.

2815        Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
2816          is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
2817          gold for sounding.

2818                 'Then music with her silver sound
2819                   With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.

2820        1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
2821        2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
2822          mourners, and stay dinner.
2823                                                               Exeunt.




2824      ACT V. Scene I.
2825      Mantua. A street.

2826      Enter Romeo.


2827        Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
2828          My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
2829          My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
2830          And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
2831          Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
2832          I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
2833          (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
2834          And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
2835          That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
2836          Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
2837          When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

2838                      Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.

2839          News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
2840          Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
2841          How doth my lady? Is my father well?
2842          How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
2843          For nothing can be ill if she be well.

2844        Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
2845          Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
2846          And her immortal part with angels lives.
2847          I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
2848          And presently took post to tell it you.
2849          O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
2850          Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

2851        Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
2852          Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
2853          And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.

2854        Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
2855          Your looks are pale and wild and do import
2856          Some misadventure.

2857        Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
2858          Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
2859          Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

2860        Man. No, my good lord.

2861        Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
2862          And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
2863                                                     Exit [Balthasar].
2864          Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
2865          Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
2866          To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
2867          I do remember an apothecary,
2868          And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
2869          In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
2870          Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
2871          Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
2872          And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
2873          An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
2874          Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
2875          A beggarly account of empty boxes,
2876          Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
2877          Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
2878          Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
2879          Noting this penury, to myself I said,
2880          'An if a man did need a poison now
2881          Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
2882          Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
2883          O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
2884          And this same needy man must sell it me.
2885          As I remember, this should be the house.
2886          Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!

2887                              Enter Apothecary.


2888        Apoth. Who calls so loud?

2889        Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
2890          Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
2891          A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
2892          As will disperse itself through all the veins
2893          That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
2894          And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
2895          As violently as hasty powder fir'd
2896          Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

2897        Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
2898          Is death to any he that utters them.

2899        Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
2900          And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
2901          Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
2902          Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
2903          The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
2904          The world affords no law to make thee rich;
2905          Then be not poor, but break it and take this.

2906        Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.

2907        Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

2908        Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
2909          And drink it off, and if you had the strength
2910          Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

2911        Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
2912          Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
2913          Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
2914          I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
2915          Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
2916          Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
2917          To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
2918                                                               Exeunt.




2919      Scene II.
2920      Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.

2921      Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.


2922        John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!

2923                            Enter Friar Laurence.


2924        Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
2925          Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
2926          Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

2927        John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
2928          One of our order, to associate me
2929          Here in this city visiting the sick,
2930          And finding him, the searchers of the town,
2931          Suspecting that we both were in a house
2932          Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
2933          Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
2934          So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

2935        Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

2936        John. I could not send it- here it is again-
2937          Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
2938          So fearful were they of infection.

2939        Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
2940          The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
2941          Of dear import; and the neglecting it
2942          May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
2943          Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
2944          Unto my cell.

2945        John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.

2946        Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
2947          Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
2948          She will beshrew me much that Romeo
2949          Hath had no notice of these accidents;
2950          But I will write again to Mantua,
2951          And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
2952          Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.




2953      Scene III.
2954      Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.

2955      Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].


2956        Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
2957          Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
2958          Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
2959          Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
2960          So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
2961          (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
2962          But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
2963          As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
2964          Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

2965        Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
2966          Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]

2967        Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
2968          (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
2969          Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
2970          Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
2971          The obsequies that I for thee will keep
2972          Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
2973                                                          Whistle Boy.
2974          The boy gives warning something doth approach.
2975          What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
2976          To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
2977          What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]

2978             Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
2979                          and a crow of iron.


2980        Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
2981          Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
2982          See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
2983          Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
2984          Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
2985          And do not interrupt me in my course.
2986          Why I descend into this bed of death
2987          Is partly to behold my lady's face,
2988          But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
2989          A precious ring- a ring that I must use
2990          In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
2991          But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
2992          In what I farther shall intend to do,
2993          By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
2994          And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
2995          The time and my intents are savage-wild,
2996          More fierce and more inexorable far
2997          Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

2998        Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

2999        Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
3000          Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.

3001        Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
3002          His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]

3003        Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3004          Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3005          Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
3006          And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
3007                                                 Romeo opens the tomb.

3008        Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
3009          That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
3010          It is supposed the fair creature died-
3011          And here is come to do some villanous shame
3012          To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
3013          Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
3014          Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
3015          Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
3016          Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

3017        Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3018          Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
3019          Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
3020          Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3021          But not another sin upon my head
3022          By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
3023          By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
3024          For I come hither arm'd against myself.
3025          Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
3026          A madman's mercy bid thee run away.

3027        Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
3028          And apprehend thee for a felon here.

3029        Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
3030                                                           They fight.

3031        Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3032                                                  [Exit. Paris falls.]

3033        Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
3034          Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]

3035        Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
3036          Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
3037          What said my man when my betossed soul
3038          Did not attend him as we rode? I think
3039          He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
3040          Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
3041          Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
3042          To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
3043          One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
3044          I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
3045          A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
3046          For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
3047          This vault a feasting presence full of light.
3048          Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
3049                                               [Lays him in the tomb.]
3050          How oft when men are at the point of death
3051          Have they been merry! which their keepers call
3052          A lightning before death. O, how may I
3053          Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
3054          Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
3055          Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
3056          Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
3057          Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
3058          And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
3059          Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
3060          O, what more favour can I do to thee
3061          Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
3062          To sunder his that was thine enemy?
3063          Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
3064          Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
3065          That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
3066          And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
3067          Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
3068          For fear of that I still will stay with thee
3069          And never from this palace of dim night
3070          Depart again. Here, here will I remain
3071          With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
3072          Will I set up my everlasting rest
3073          And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
3074          From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
3075          Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
3076          The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
3077          A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
3078          Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
3079          Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
3080          The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
3081          Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
3082          Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.

3083          Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.


3084        Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
3085          Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

3086        Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

3087        Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
3088          What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
3089          To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
3090          It burneth in the Capels' monument.

3091        Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
3092          One that you love.

3093        Friar. Who is it?

3094        Bal. Romeo.

3095        Friar. How long hath he been there?

3096        Bal. Full half an hour.

3097        Friar. Go with me to the vault.

3098        Bal. I dare not, sir.
3099          My master knows not but I am gone hence,
3100          And fearfully did menace me with death
3101          If I did stay to look on his intents.

3102        Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
3103          O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.

3104        Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
3105          I dreamt my master and another fought,
3106          And that my master slew him.

3107        Friar. Romeo!
3108          Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
3109          The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
3110          What mean these masterless and gory swords
3111          To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
3112          Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
3113          And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
3114          Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
3115                                                         Juliet rises.

3116        Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
3117          I do remember well where I should be,
3118          And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

3119        Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
3120          Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
3121          A greater power than we can contradict
3122          Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
3123          Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
3124          And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
3125          Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
3126          Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
3127          Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

3128        Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
3129                                                         Exit [Friar].
3130          What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
3131          Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
3132          O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
3133          To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
3134          Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
3135          To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
3136          Thy lips are warm!

3137        Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
3138          Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
3139                                            [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
3140          This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
3141                        She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].

3142                      Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.


3143        Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.

3144        Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
3145          Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
3146                                           [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
3147          Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
3148          And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
3149          Who here hath lain this two days buried.
3150          Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
3151          Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
3152                                         [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
3153          We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
3154          But the true ground of all these piteous woes
3155          We cannot without circumstance descry.

3156           Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].

3157        2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.

3158        Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.

3159                Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.

3160        3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
3161          We took this mattock and this spade from him
3162          As he was coming from this churchyard side.

3163        Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.

3164                    Enter the Prince [and Attendants].


3165        Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
3166          That calls our person from our morning rest?

3167                  Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].


3168        Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

3169        Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
3170          Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
3171          With open outcry, toward our monument.

3172        Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?

3173        Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
3174          And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
3175          Warm and new kill'd.

3176        Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

3177        Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
3178          With instruments upon them fit to open
3179          These dead men's tombs.

3180        Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
3181          This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
3182          Is empty on the back of Montague,
3183          And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!

3184        Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
3185          That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

3186                     Enter Montague [and others].


3187        Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
3188          To see thy son and heir more early down.

3189        Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
3190          Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
3191          What further woe conspires against mine age?

3192        Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.

3193        Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
3194          To press before thy father to a grave?

3195        Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
3196          Till we can clear these ambiguities
3197          And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
3198          And then will I be general of your woes
3199          And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
3200          And let mischance be slave to patience.
3201          Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

3202        Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
3203          Yet most suspected, as the time and place
3204          Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
3205          And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
3206          Myself condemned and myself excus'd.

3207        Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.

3208        Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
3209          Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
3210          Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
3211          And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
3212          I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
3213          Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
3214          Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
3215          For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
3216          You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
3217          Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
3218          To County Paris. Then comes she to me
3219          And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
3220          To rid her from this second marriage,
3221          Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
3222          Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
3223          A sleeping potion; which so took effect
3224          As I intended, for it wrought on her
3225          The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
3226          That he should hither come as this dire night
3227          To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
3228          Being the time the potion's force should cease.
3229          But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
3230          Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
3231          Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
3232          At the prefixed hour of her waking
3233          Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
3234          Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
3235          Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
3236          But when I came, some minute ere the time
3237          Of her awaking, here untimely lay
3238          The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
3239          She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
3240          And bear this work of heaven with patience;
3241          But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
3242          And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
3243          But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
3244          All this I know, and to the marriage
3245          Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
3246          Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
3247          Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
3248          Unto the rigour of severest law.

3249        Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
3250          Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?

3251        Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
3252          And then in post he came from Mantua
3253          To this same place, to this same monument.
3254          This letter he early bid me give his father,
3255          And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
3256          If I departed not and left him there.

3257        Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
3258          Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
3259          Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

3260        Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
3261          And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
3262          Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
3263          And by-and-by my master drew on him;
3264          And then I ran away to call the watch.

3265        Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
3266          Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
3267          And here he writes that he did buy a poison
3268          Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
3269          Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
3270          Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
3271          See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
3272          That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
3273          And I, for winking at you, discords too,
3274          Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.

3275        Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
3276          This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
3277          Can I demand.

3278        Mon. But I can give thee more;
3279          For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
3280          That whiles Verona by that name is known,
3281          There shall no figure at such rate be set
3282          As that of true and faithful Juliet.

3283        Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
3284          Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

3285        Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
3286          The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
3287          Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
3288          Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
3289          For never was a story of more woe
3290          Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
3291                                                         Exeunt omnes.

3292      THE END
